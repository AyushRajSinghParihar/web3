# Web3 Personal Projects
This repository contains a collection of personal projects that reflect my journey and learnings in Web3 technologies, primarily guided by Harkirat's cohort. Each project explores different facets of decentralized applications, blockchain development, smart contracts, and more, with a focus on hands-on implementation and experimentation in the Web3 ecosystem.
